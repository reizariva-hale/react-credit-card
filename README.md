This exercise was from Dave Ceddia's Learn Pure React book.


Task:
Create a CreditCard component based on this design. Style it up with CSS or inline styles. Accept a cardInfo prop that contains the personâ€™s name, expiration date, credit card number, and bank name.

This is what it should look like.
